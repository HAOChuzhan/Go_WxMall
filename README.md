# Go_WxMall
This is a simple wechat mall code based on Gin framework development (Golang).  
The following is the project directory structure：

```text
| folder      | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| conf  |   configuration   |
| controller  | api     |
|middleware| jwt···|
|models |···|
|routers  |···|
|pkg|utils|
|go.mod| package management|
|go.sum|same as above|
|mian.go|entrance|
```

We can manage projects using <kbd>Go Mod</kbd> which is very convenient. You can find out how to implement Gomod. (It is important to understand files ***go.mod*** and ***go.sum***.)
